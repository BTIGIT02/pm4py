Description: Interface to 'PM4py' <http://pm4py.org>, a process mining library 
    in 'Python'. This package uses the 'reticulate' package to act as a bridge 
    between 'PM4Py' and the 'R' package 'bupaR'. It provides several process 
    discovery algorithms, evaluation measures, and alignments.
